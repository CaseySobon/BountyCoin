# BountyCoin

## Description
This project is to experiment with blockchains to create a system for tracking contributions to a project.

The BountyCoin is a Python-based blockchain program designed to transparently and securely track contributions to a project. Leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures a tamper-resistant and immutable ledger of all contributions, fostering trust and accountability within the project community.

The idea for this project was based on the Covid-related remote work trend which created interest for off-site contribution. However, this comes at a loss of visibility and accountability. My idea was to make a simple way to monetize the contributions in a fare but secure way with no need for constant supervision.

## Features 
#### Decentralized Ledger:

* Utilize a blockchain network to maintain a decentralized ledger of all project contributions.
* Enhance transparency by allowing all participants to access and verify the contribution history.

#### Immutable Record:

* Ensure the integrity of contribution data by implementing a consensus mechanism that prevents unauthorized modifications to the blockchain.

#### Smart Contracts:

* Employ smart contracts to automate contribution validation and execution of predefined rules.
* Smart contracts can enforce conditions for accepting contributions, such as minimum/maximum amounts, verification criteria, etc.

#### User Authentication and Authorization:

* Implement secure user authentication to ensure that only authorized individuals can submit contributions.
* Define different user roles with specific permissions, such as contributors, project administrators, and auditors.

#### Tokenization:

* Introduce a native project token to represent contributions, allowing for easier tracking and transfer of value within the system.
* Enable contributors to trade or transfer their tokens, enhancing liquidity and flexibility.

#### Web Interface:

* Develop a user-friendly web interface for participants to view their contributions, project progress, and overall statistics.
* Ensure accessibility across various devices for a seamless user experience.

## Scope:

#### Blockchain Implementation:

* Use the Ethereum framework to implement the core blockchain functionalities.
* Set up nodes to maintain the decentralized network.

#### Smart Contract Development:

* Design and deploy smart contracts to manage contribution validation and execute predefined rules.
* Implement event triggers to update the blockchain with each valid contribution.

#### User Authentication and Authorization:

* Develop a secure authentication system for user access.
* Establish different user roles and permissions, enforcing access control throughout the platform.

#### Tokenization:

* Integrate a token system to represent project contributions.
* Implement token transfer functionality with appropriate safeguards.

#### Web Interface:

* Design and develop a web-based user interface using a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, Django).
* Enable users to view their contributions, project statistics, and interact with the system.

## Getting Started

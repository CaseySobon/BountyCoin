# BountyCoin

## Description:
This project is to experiment with blockchains to create a system for tracking contributions to a project.

The BountyCoin is a Python-based blockchain program designed to transparently and securely track contributions to a project. Leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures a tamper-resistant and immutable ledger of all contributions, fostering trust and accountability within the project community.

## Scope:
### Decentralized Ledger:

* Utilize a blockchain network to maintain a decentralized ledger of all project contributions.
* Enhance transparency by allowing all participants to access and verify the contribution history.

### Immutable Record:

* Ensure the integrity of contribution data by implementing a consensus mechanism that prevents unauthorized modifications to the blockchain.

### Smart Contracts:

* Employ smart contracts to automate contribution validation and execution of predefined rules.
* Smart contracts can enforce conditions for accepting contributions, such as minimum/maximum amounts, verification criteria, etc.

### User Authentication and Authorization:

* Implement secure user authentication to ensure that only authorized individuals can submit contributions.
* Define different user roles with specific permissions, such as contributors, project administrators, and auditors.

Tokenization:

Introduce a native project token to represent contributions, allowing for easier tracking and transfer of value within the system.
Enable contributors to trade or transfer their tokens, enhancing liquidity and flexibility.
Web Interface:

Develop a user-friendly web interface for participants to view their contributions, project progress, and overall statistics.
Ensure accessibility across various devices for a seamless user experience.
Scope:

Blockchain Implementation:

Choose a suitable blockchain framework (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) and implement the core blockchain functionalities.
Set up nodes to maintain the decentralized network.
Smart Contract Development:

Design and deploy smart contracts to manage contribution validation and execute predefined rules.
Implement event triggers to update the blockchain with each valid contribution.
User Authentication and Authorization:

Develop a secure authentication system for user access.
Establish different user roles and permissions, enforcing access control throughout the platform.
Tokenization:

Integrate a token system to represent project contributions.
Implement token transfer functionality with appropriate safeguards.
Web Interface:

Design and develop a web-based user interface using a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, Django).
Enable users to view their contributions, project statistics, and interact with the system.
Testing and Security:

Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security audits.
Implement security best practices to protect against vulnerabilities.
Documentation:

Provide comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and usage of the Decentralized Contribution Tracker.
Include a user guide and developer documentation for future maintenance and enhancements.
